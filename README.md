## Bitnine Intership Question No.1
Using this structure, please write a function that returns fibonacci sequence based on the following arithmetic operations (+, -,*, /) and conditions.
The fibonacci function should be implemented using Dynamic Programming.

Installations
Compilation



## Installations
Install C language to your local machine,such as GCC or Clang. so that code can be run and can be seen what it tyring to do.

## Compilation
you can use the terminal within Visual Studio Code to compile and run the code.
Use the following command to compile the source code: "gcc -o [output_file] [source_file].c" 
Replace [output_file] with the desired name for the executable file, and [source_file] with the name of the source file. 




## Bitnine Intership Question No.2
Implement the following piecewise recurrence relation in the 3 different ways. 
Explain the differences (advantages, disadvantages) between the 3.
Must be written in C.

Understing of Programming in C language

## Installations

## Compilation
you can use the terminal within Visual Studio Code to compile and run the code.
Use the following command to compile the source code: "gcc -o [output_file] [source_file].c" 
Replace [output_file] with the desired name for the executable file, and [source_file] with the name of the source file. 

## Recursive
This implementation is simple to understand and implement, but it has a high time complexity due to the repetitive function calls. 
This can lead to a stack overflow if n is large.

## Iterative
This implementation has a lower time complexity as it avoids repetitive function calls. 
However, it takes up more memory as it uses additional variables to store the values.

## Dynamic Programming
This implementation uses an array to store the already computed values, thus avoiding repetitive function calls. 
This reduces the time complexity and also the memory complexity is less as compared to iterative implementation. 
But the space complexity is more as it uses an array to store the values.
Overall, dynamic programming is the best method to solve the problems as it has the lowest time complexity and also the space complexity is less as compared to iterative implementation.

## Code Summary
In summary, the recursive method is simple to understand but slow and inefficient, the iterative method is faster but requires more space, and dynamic programming is the best method to solve the problem as it has the lowest time complexity and also the space complexity is less as compared to iterative implementation.
